I"ž<p>I have been a technical writer for more than eight years in several different settings. I learn remarkably quickly, and my researching skills are outstanding.</p>

<p>The majority of my career has been in advertising and technical copywriting.</p>

<p>Four years were spent working with the United States Agency for International Development, where I specialized in Business Development, which has undoubtedly been my favorite field. This position had the most variety, from official letters to courses and news writing and proposals.</p>

<p>I am here to help you achieve your goals, and I am passionate about my belief that together, we can achieve anything.</p>

<p>I have joined Upwork in April 2021, gained two clients from day one who I still work with to this day, as we are enjoying our collaboration together.</p>

<p>Although I thoroughly enjoy technical writing, I am a competent, creative writer and would like to have more opportunities to employ my imagination. I write best about topics that interest me or that I feel passionate about. My sense of humor is generally decent, but I also have a satirical streak in my writing when appropriate. And I have to admit; I am most interested in creative writing for my freelance work, Beside my Arabic-English Translation gig.</p>

<p>My writing style is not for everyone. With customer satisfaction as my primary focus, I am more interested in quality. With that in mind, I want to make sure that the product meets or exceeds expectations, even if it means doing extra work upfront or toward the end. Writing has always been something I do for fun, and I love the idea that it can help others while keeping me happily occupied.</p>
